# Overly Complicated Hello World

### Do whatever you want with this monstrous creation. But remember: with great complexity comes great confusion.

Do you enjoy complexity, unnecessary templates, and metaprogramming madness for something that could have been done with a single `std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";`? You're in the right place.

**Highlights include:**
- Nested templates that would make your C++ professor cry.
- Metafunctions that compute the length of a fixed string at compile-time. Because who doesn’t love compile-time string length checks?
- A class hierarchy rivaling that of a small empire, just to print eleven characters and a newline.
- Enough macro expansions to impress your cat (assuming your cat understands macros).
- A custom allocator that really doesn’t do anything special, but it’s there to make everything look fancier.

### How to Build

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
